## 🚀 The Problem: AI APIs Are Burning Your Budget

AI assistants are revolutionizing developer productivity, but their API costs quickly add up:

- 💸 **Expensive API Calls**: $0.002-$0.015 per 1K tokens means $200+ monthly for active users
- ⏱️ **Complex Setup**: Hours spent debugging MCP server configurations instead of coding
- 🔄 **Ongoing Fees**: Commercial APIs create perpetual costs for what should be a basic utility

## 💬 Developer Testimonials

> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Finally! A Task Planner That Doesn't Cost a Fortune."
>
> "I was hesitant about AI planning due to API costs. This package was incredibly easy to set up thanks to the guide, and using Qwen via OpenRouter costs me literally nothing. My workflow is faster, more organized, and I'm saving over $60/month. A total no-brainer for any serious AI coder user."
